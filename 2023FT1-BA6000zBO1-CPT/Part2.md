Hi, Professor,

Could you help to confirm below questions about the Part 2 assignment:
1, Do we need a new Agreement to be signed for each semester with the new start/end date of that semester?
2, Does the Employment Verification Letter works as a Job Offer letter?
3, Does the start/end date on the the EVL/Job Offer need to be same as the agreement? 
4, If the employer does not provide new versions of EVL/Job offer to update the start/end date, could we upload the same EVL/Job offer letter for different semester?
