Hi, everyone

This is Hang Yang from Chicago. With several years of working experience in the IT industry, the data storage and network security become more and more significant around the Internet. To better understand, manage and protect the data, I feel it's quite a good chance to learn more professional views on these topics at Trine. 

I'm so excited to start my first on-seated class (INF503-Advanced database) of MSIS program this fall at Detroit Education Center. By taking the class, I hope to explore high-level concepts and strategies for database administration to optimize business practices which include performance management, data integrity and disaster management. I'm looking forward to the workshops and labs in the class.

Tips: During my free time, I like coding, cooking, joggling and reading books with my family.
