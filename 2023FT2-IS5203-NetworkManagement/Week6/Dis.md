	* Ease of Memorization: Passphrases are often easier to remember, facilitating user adherence to security practices.
In essence, the debate between passphrases and passwords underscores the importance of considering factors such as length, ease of use, and adaptability to evolving security landscapes. Ultimately, the effectiveness of password strategies hinges on their practical implementation and the commitment of users to adhere to sound security practices.
