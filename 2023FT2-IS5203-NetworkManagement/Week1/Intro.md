Hi, everyone! My name is Hang Yang, and I'm a Chicago-based deep-dish crust fan. I hold a master's degree in Computer Science and began my career as a full-stack web application developer after graduating in Chicago. It was an excellent place where I could connect with real-world requirements from both internal operations teams and external clients, as well as collaborate with other talented team members. We were all motivated to deliver high-reliability, availability, and durable products to our end-users. At times, root cause analysis would lead to network instability. In my previous experiences, network diagnosis and management were somewhat of a black box to me. This course will undoubtedly help me continue learning, progressing, and striving to build clean code and fantastic deliverables.

I live with my family in the suburban area of Illinois, and I typically spend most of my time with them. I believe I play an important role in their lives, just as they do in mine. Besides that, during my personal moments, I like to stay quiet and become a bookworm. Whether it's reading a real-time newspaper or diving into a fictional book, it satisfies me. However, I'm most drawn to historical stories because I believe that "Past experiences guide the future," and this principle applies in most cases.
