# In your opinion at this point in your career, what do you believe is the greatest threat network admins should work to mitigate on their networks?

From my perspective, the narrative of cloud security stands out as one of the most dynamically evolving topics of concern for both businesses and individuals. With the widespread adoption of cloud services by an increasing number of companies, a multitude of applications in the market now rely on cloud infrastructure. This shift signifies that not only the sensitive data of corporations but also our personal data, including privacy-sensitive information, could potentially be exposed to cyber threats if unauthorized access occurs. Therefore, as network administrators, meticulous consideration is imperative when deciding on cloud products. Network administrators should adopt a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, including user education, implementing robust security policies, deploying advanced threat detection tools, and staying informed about emerging threats and best practices. Additionally, a proactive stance on continuous monitoring and incident response is vital in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.

Thank you for outlining some common network threat concerns, including unauthorized access, malware, and phishing. These issues undoubtedly pose significant challenges and potential losses for both businesses and individuals. Addressing and mitigating the impact of these concerns requires a diverse range of approaches. For examples: 
* Conducting periodic audits of user access privileges to identify and rectify any unauthorized or unnecessary permissions. 
* Deploying up-to-date antivirus software that can detect and neutralize a wide range of malware threats. 
* Employing advanced email filtering systems to automatically detect and quarantine phishing attempts.

In a rapidly evolving threat landscape, a combination of proactive measures, user education, and technological solutions is essential for building robust defenses against network threats. Thank you for bringing attention to these critical issues and the need for multifaceted mitigation strategies.
