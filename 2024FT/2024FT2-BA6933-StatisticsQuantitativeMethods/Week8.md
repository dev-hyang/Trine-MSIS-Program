Bayes' Theorem is an approach to predict the probability of some outcomes happening by using new information, like observations, and what we already know. It’s named after a great British mathematician named Thomas Bayes and helps us update our guesses when we get new facts. For example, in business, it can help companies figure out the risk of making certain decisions or investing in projects.

In Oceanview’s case, Bayes' Theorem helped estimate whether voters would approve a zoning change for a property. A market research firm gave predictions about voter behavior, and Bayes' Theorem helped combine these predictions with prior knowledge to make better decisions. The analysis showed that if the research predicts voter approval, Oceanview should bid, as the expected profit is high. If the research predicts rejection, they should skip the bid to avoid losses.

In our case, paying the market research increased Oceanview’s confidence in making the right choice, which would increase their potential profit from $50,000 to $455,475. This shows how valuable the Bayes' Theorem is for decision-making. It provides a logical way to handle uncertainty, especially in tricky situations like bidding or investments. By combining old and new information, it ensures smarter, more calculated decisions.

Hi, Guido Marson,

This is really a great analysis summary regarding the case problem with detailed step explanation. It's intuitive to understand what you've implemented in order to make the final decision as the Oceanview manager role. I feel the challeging part is to simplify the problems as we know there seems to be lots of decision to be made, like bid the project, sealed the bid, forfeit the bid, accept the bid, buy the property, build the condo (under approval). I would appreciate if you have any more insights on how to make it. Thanks

Hi, Cheney Canada

I like this quick and simplified wrap-up on the case problem. It gets reader to the point that the Oceanview should hire the market research company to do the preliminary analysis and prediction on the zoning change vote. Because the direct benefit is that the potential revenue profit is much higher than do nothing. In the business domains, we would find similar scenarios happen again and again. It seems that who owns more information would gain more advantage over others. This highlight the value, accuracy and accountability of the information. From this case problem, the Oceanview choose the market research company because they previous have close cooperation. In reality, how to judge the information accuracy and accountability might still be a challenging topic among managers.
