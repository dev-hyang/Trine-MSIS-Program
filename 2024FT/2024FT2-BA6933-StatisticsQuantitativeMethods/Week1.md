# Self Introduction
Hello, Everyone,

I am Hang Yang and I'm so glad to attend the Statistics and Quantitative Methods course with you all this semester ! I have already spent three semesters at Trine University and felt so thankful for all the learning activities, teachings and coworks within this community. I really hope that we could have a great journey ahead in the course.

Before joining Trine, I worked as a software engineer in Chicago, west side of the Michigan lake. In some of my previous projects, I've learnt the concept of data analyst and its importance. Some of role responsibilities of a data analyst include data collection, data cleansing, data validation, data transformation, data analysis and data statistics. I felt interested in above domains and this course could give me more insights on these area.

Besides work and study, I would like to spend time hiking or playing table tennis with my friends.

Best wishes,

Hang Yang

Hi, Zoey,

It's so nice to meet you, a 10 year Jay Chou fan in this course. It's my first time to hear the title of in-house counsel from the supplement manufacturing company. May I know what the daily routine is as a in-house counsel? Also I feel quite interested in the software packages or toolkits that you might use in your daily work. The reason that I attend the course is that I want to know more of the data statistics and data manipulation techniques which might benefit my career as a data engineer in future. What are your expectations of the course?

Best
Hang

Hi, Guido,

Glad to meet you here at the course. Is Roger Federer an idol for most of the tennis players? I do know that Federe is called the super GOAT in the tennis area and get inspired by his continuous hardship, sportsmanship, as well as charity activities. Italy is a new and uncharted territory for me, filled with numerous beautiful and known cities. I really want to go on a trip to Italy some day in future after graduation from Trine. Hope you a great time ahead in this course and at Trine MBA program.

Best Wishes
Hang

* A summary (in a few sentences) of the business problem the study/article/example proposes to solve.
* An example of descriptive statistics that are used to solve the problem.
* Include the article link in your post.

Descriptive statistics is a good approach to help organizations gain insights and make better decisions by providing an intuitive way to understand the aspects of data sets themselves. For instance, organizations often make budget decisions based on annual statistical reports. Moreover, it also has huge impact on individuals. For us as Trine students, the statistics of the course grading, such as averages, means or modes, could matter a lot. By reading the statistics, we could allocate time and effort more effectively. Descriptive statistics really plays a critical role in our daily life.

In the below news article, the authors gives a good explanation and some concepts of descriptive statistics. The clinic aimed to assist its diabete patients to better control the glucose. Therefore it launched a 9-month quality improvement project to help its patient to monitor the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI). To practice descriptive statistic strategies, it collected triple 3-months aggregate data and put them in the tabular format for analysis. During its data analysis process, it efficiently applied descriptive statistics in those data sets. For example, it used central tendancy meansures, like mean and median based on age group which could help the clinic to identify demographic groups. What's more, it also include variability measures, like standard deviation and range to help locate spread of hbA1c increase or decrease. Range can help to spot outliers. In the last, it attached several graphical charts to illustrate the comparison for average histograms in HbA1c/BMI preintervention and post-intervention difference.

The news article highlights the importance of descriptive statistics in the healthcare industry. It plays a crucial role in understanding experiments and can help doctors adjust their approaches or prescriptions in the future.

Hi, Jiahui,

This is a really great post on the benefits and importance of how the descriptive statistics bring into commercial appliations. Uber Eats is really one of the most toppest popular delivery platforms among Gen-Z. To understand how the customers reflects on the user experience and its ads recall rate, the linked article includes important graphical charts, categorical variables, and numerical measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc. It would be better if the survey data tables could be included into the linked article where it shows only the final percentages on all the statistics data.

It's really an simplified and intutive introduction to the most frequent pattern of descriptive statistics, the mean, median, mode measures of data sets. I believe that those numerical measures have great advantages over others in some business cases to offer more meaningful insights to the decision team. Sometimes, we would also consider the graphical charts like bar, histogram, pie chart, and tabular data would add great values to the presentation.
