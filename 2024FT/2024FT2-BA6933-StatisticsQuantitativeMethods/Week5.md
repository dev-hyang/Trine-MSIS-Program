Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the value of an independent variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the two variables, represented by a straight-line equation defined by a slope and a y-intercept. This tool is widely used to analyze and forecast trends, making it invaluable in fields like finance, science, and business.

Before conducting a simple linear regression analysis, certain assumptions must be met (Bobbitt, 2020):

Homogeneity of variance: The variance of the residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) remains consistent across all levels of the independent variable.
Independence of observations: Data points are independent, meaning the outcome of one observation does not influence another.\
Normality: The residuals should follow a normal distribution.
A critical metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a regression model is the coefficient of determination (ùëü2). A higher ùëü2 value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. However, ùëü2 alone is insufficient; additional factors like the test of significance should be considered. The error term (residual), representing the difference between actual and predicted values, helps identify model limitations and potential outliers. There are also several hypothesis test around the slope and y-intercept which is used to determine if it's a good fit for the whole dataset.

Outliers are the most interesting topic from my viewpoint. The outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the trend line and can undermine the model's accuracy. Simple linear regression provides intuitive visual insights into outliers, which often appear as points far from the line of best fit. To identify them quantitatively, standardized residuals are analyzed, with values typically falling between -2 and +2 under normal conditions. Outliers outside this range may indicate anomalies or data issues requiring further investigation. These could be used in many fields like statistics, medician development, science research, etc.

Your explanation of the simple linear regression is very intuitive and succint. The simple linear regression model is said to be the simplest type of linear regression cluster and its main purpose is commonly be ignored. Because nowadays there are many variations to be considered for certain event. However, in some specific fields, like science research in medicine, biology, agriculture, there are controlled experiment which might focus on certain factors. Like the relationship between rainfall and food production, we could use the simple linear regression to verify if it has a strong correlation. So if there is a strong need to predict a certain value (dependent variable) over another (independent variable), we could consider using the simple linear regression model under reasonable assumptions.

Your post and infographic design is clear and amazing. By reading those charts and diagrams, I leart the concept of simple linear regression model beyond the words. But it's worth to mentioning that it's better to add more details on how to conduct the simple linear regression analysis. For example, we could take use of the formulas provided from the textbook to calculate the slope and the y-intercept of the estimated regression equation. I would give a like to the chart that is titled with "reported happiness as a function of income". Even though I believe there is no direct cause-effect between happiness and income, the chart shows the trend that people feel happier as income increases.
