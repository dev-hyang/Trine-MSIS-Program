Hello, everyone,

My name is Hang Yang, and I appreciate the opportunity to give this brief introduction. I currently work as a software engineer in the greater Chicago area, which is one of the reasons I chose Trine University—an esteemed institution in the region. I’ve completed two terms in the MSIS program, and I really enjoyed the past courses with the instructors and course advisors.

Some courses have left a lasting impression on me, particularly those with good communication, well-prepared learning materials and labs, such as network management, Java, and cybersecurity. These courses have provided me with valuable perspectives, helping me approach projects with a holistic view, taking into account not only business implementation but also security, readability, and extensibility.

I believe the System Engineering Analysis course will offer me more systematic training and insights, helping me connect the knowledge I’ve gained from previous courses and transition from fragmented knowledge to a cohesive understanding.
