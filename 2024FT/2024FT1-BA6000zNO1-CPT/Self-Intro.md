Hello, everyone,

My name is Hang Yang and I resides in Big Chicago Area, Illinois. I'm planning to get my Master of Science degree in Information Studies(MSIS) at Trine. The reason I choose Trine as back to school target is due to its high credit in this area and I'm interested in the magic of mining powerfulness from the data information. The most interesting course I've learnt so far is Cybersecurity which is instructed by Mr. Martinez. The teaching style and materials used are up-to-date technology which could provide strong support into real-life working environment. What's more, parts of the videos are free youtube public videos recorded by IBM. At Trine, I got my first time video assignment experience in this course which help to elevate my presentation skills. By taking this CPT course, I hope to gain some internal insights from other classmates and sharing from different working domains. Hope you all a great term ahead.

Hi, Yunze,

It's so nice to hear from your sharing in this course. I'm also planning to get my master degree in MSIS program at Trine. I do agree that the Java programming is quite interesting, but the one I took is a little bit overloadded. Besides that the knowledge sharing and learning materials from the Java course are supportive to career development in the early stage. The great thing about CPT course is pacing our way to industry. If you are in the industry, you may also benefit from the management approaches here.

Hi, Minmin,

So glad to meet you in this course. I feel so interested in the life and work in New York. New York is absolutely a big metropolitan city with people from all around the world, full of diversity --- similar to what we experience here at Trine. I'm currently studying the MSIS program, but I only have basic understanding of MSBAN. Your introduction gave me some great insights into business analysis and decision-making.

Do you use any programming languages or specific toolkits in your daily work? I've been impressed by the feedback on your couress from other students. Wishing you a great Fall term ahead.
