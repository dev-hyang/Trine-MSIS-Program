Hi, 

This is Hang Yang from Chicago. With several years of working experience in the IT industry, the significant value of data is impressive in my mind. As the performance of data storage and querying is still an existing challenge for many software engineers, I've read some online blogs around the topic. Some of them are initiative, and some are somehow biased. To better understand, manage and protect the data, I feel so excited to start the INF 503 Advanced Database class as my first class from the MSIS program at Trine. 

During my free time, I like cooking, joggling and reading books with my family. 

Looking forward to meeting you all ahead.
