## 19 Question
My internship involves working as a software developer to create new features for a web application. The web application is built on the ASP.NET framework using C#, an object-oriented programming language. I am also responsible for building RESTful APIs using a microservice architecture, enabling the company's platform to integrate with third-party client platforms.

These tasks closely align with the course design of the MSIS program at Trine University. The Java and Object-Oriented Programming courses have given me the strength and confidence to build code blocks effectively. Additionally, the cybersecurity and database courses have paved the way for me to write efficient and secure scripts. I am grateful for this program.

In the past 2024 Fall semester, the course SYS5013 System Engineering Analysis impressed me a lot by its inspiring discussion topics, well-organized textbook and reading materials, as well as the design project assignments. The course instructor Hitam Zidan also gave a fantastic presentation on the intialization of system design using agile approach during the seated classes. 

From the begining of the course, I've been surprised by the hand-on design assignments. It's really helpful for me to strengthen the knowledge points into practices. In the design of data flow diagram (DFD), I learnt how to draft a design prototype in a top-down order: from context diagram (also known as level 0) iteratively decomposing into detailed leven n. While in the uniformal modeling language (UML) use case diagram design, the dialog-pattern design really inspired me to design the system as you are the actual end user. This could help give us a better mindset from a high level overview before we push the implementation of low level design details. During the human computer interaction (HCI) topic, especially for UI/UX part, it included a lot of detailed handy work to build the website or mobile app design pages. Even a small portion of the design input matters, such as the size, placement of a small button or the font and color of textarea. 

Throughout the course, there was a strong emphasis on the value of agile approach, communication and retrospective feedback. These practices are critical for identifying potential issues early, such as miscommunication, design flaws, or unintended bugs, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to increased costs and inefficiencies. By fostering clear communication and embracing changes, teams can be more adaptive and avoid costly mistakes and ensure alignment, ultimately resulting in more effective project outcomes and optimized resources. This approach not only saves time and budget but also enhances the overall quality and success of the project.

Hi Mingyi,

I'm glad to see that you've applied such a lot of knowledge from the learnings into your real-world working tasks. As a software developer, I've totally understand the importance and satisfaction when we could applied the knowledge into pratice. Especially in the situation where these knowledge could lead to the final solution. Hope you have a great journey in future at Trine.

Thank you for your illustrations and case examples. I am encouraged by your learning goals and case studies at Trine University. At times, I found it challenging to focus on my studies due to the difficulty of maintaining a good GPA while balancing work. Seeing how effectively you've applied knowledge to achieve tangible work outcomes is inspiring and provides a valuable reference for me. Even though I am not in the finance or statistics field, I can see that the course materials are truly beneficial for building a better career in the future. Thank you.
