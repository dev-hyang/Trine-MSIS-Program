Discuss the difference between classes, sealing classes, and objects. In your discussion also explain why you would want to define a new class as well as list at least two sealed class rules.

Defining a new class stands as a foundational pillar in the realm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This practice is instrumental in achieving the principles of abstraction and encapsulation by bringing together common attributes and methods, encapsulating the essence of real-world entities. Abstraction allows designers to conceptualize complex systems by assembling related attributes and functionalities into a cohesive unit, often referred to as a module or class. This process of decomposition enhances the manageability of code by breaking down intricate systems into smaller, more comprehensible components. These modular units, represented by individual classes or sets of closely related classes, contribute significantly to the readability of a system. Each class encapsulates a specific set of responsibilities, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the codebase. This modular approach not only enhances code readability but also sets the stage for leveraging other key aspects of OOP, such as inheritance and polymorphism.

In the grand scheme of OOP, classes provide a structured and flexible means to model and represent entities within a program. This not only enhances code organization but also contributes to its maintainability. By adopting a modular and well-organized approach, designers can create systems that are not only readable and maintainable but also capable of evolving gracefully with changing requirements. In essence, classes serve as the building blocks that empower developers to craft scalable, organized, and maintainable software solutions.

Two Rules of sealed classes contains:
* it restricts the list of subclasses that can extend it explicitly.
* it's usually marked by the keyword permits and sealed.

Thank you for your insightful introduction to classes and objects, along with their distinctions. The examples provided indeed make the concepts easily graspable. It's worth highlighting that the concept of a class is at the very heart of Object-Oriented Programming, encompassing key principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance. In the world of OOP, a class serves as more than just a blueprint for objects; it encapsulates the fundamental building blocks that enable the creation of robust and scalable software systems. Here's a brief exploration of how the core OOP concepts align with the concept of a class: Abstraction, Encapsulation and Inheritance. Understanding the centrality of classes in OOP involves recognizing them as vessels that embody these core principles. Through well-designed classes, developers can effectively model real-world scenarios, promote code reuse, and build systems that are both maintainable and extensible.

This serves as an intuitive introduction to the concepts of class, object, and sealed class, highlighting their importance in the realm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). What stands out is the emphasis on the significance of these concepts in shaping the structure and organization of software.

It's noteworthy that, according to textbook explanations, one of the rules for sealed classes suggests that subclasses or derived classes may not necessarily be required to reside in the same source code file; rather, they can coexist in the same package. An interesting observation is that the use of the permits keyword could be optional if these subclasses are defined within the same source code file. This flexibility adds a layer of convenience to the syntax, making the implementation of sealed classes more adaptable to different coding scenarios.

The clarity of these concepts and the nuances you've presented contribute to a comprehensive understanding, making these fundamental principles of OOP approachable for learners and developers alike. If you have any further questions or if there's more you'd like to delve into, feel free to explore!
