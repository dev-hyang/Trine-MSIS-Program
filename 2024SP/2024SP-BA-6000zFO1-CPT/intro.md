#QA
Hi, everyone

I'm Hang Yang from Chicago, and I joined Trine last Fall semester to pursue my Master's in MSIS program. With several years of experience in the IT industry as a software developer specializing in backend service domains, I recognize the importance of programming understandings and design patterns as fundamental elements in an SDE role. My goal is to advance my career to the staff developer level, and I believe returning to school to sharpen my technical knowledge will be beneficial.

My favorite course thus far is Advanced Database, where I designed a restaurant recipe management system. This project allowed me to apply the knowledge points we learned in the course, such as schema, relationships, views, SQL, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc. As a food enthusiast, I dream of seeing my recipe app go live one day to support my culinary adventures. Cheers!

In my free time, I enjoy coding, cooking, jogging, and reading books with my family.

Hang Yang, MSIS, Chicago

It's a pleasure to connect with you here at Trine. I'm delighted to learn that your first year has been a wonderful experience. I'm currently enrolled in the OOP in Java course this semester, and I've found it to be more comprehensive than initially anticipated. Your positive experience provides valuable insight and inspiration for me â€” I'll aim to engage more actively and foster communication in the course. Wishing you a fantastic journey ahead as you embark on your second year!
