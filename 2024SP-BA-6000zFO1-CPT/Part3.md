## 19 Question
My internship is working as a software developer in building a property maintenance web application. The daily responsibilities mainly focusing on designing and building new features of the application by facilitating programming frameworks and tricks. The classes of IS5103-Java OOP and IS5403-Cybersecurity helps me to deepen the understanding of those programming concepts, like high availability, high accountability, high reliablity and high security. By applying the knowledge points and lab practices from the hybrid classes, I could confidently complete the work assignments on time to make the maintenance web application stable and secure.


# Final Reflection Dis
Throughout this semester, I've learnt Java programming in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Cybersecurity. My employer is a real estate tech company which provides services to clients through a microservices platform. Both the system stability and information security of customer data are paramount. While the company's legacy tech stack invests mostly around the .NET Core framework, newer microservices are embracing languages like Java, Python, and Go. Given my prior focus on C#/.NET Core, I realized the urgency of mastering Java for my daily tasks. Recently, I implemented some Java-based microservice features while simultaneously taking the Java programming course. The course equipped me with essential knowledge, enabling me to seamlessly apply concepts like access methods, inheritance, and stream operations to solve different programming assignments. The positive feedback I received reinforced my confidence in honing my programming skills.

Another instance where the Java OOP course proved invaluable was when I cleaned and refactored a legacy .NET standard project. Implementing DIY and SOLID principles gleaned from external research, I leveraged inheritance and overloaded methods from the abstract factory pattern. This approach significantly cleaned the codebase, boosting efficiency by 10% while eliminating thousands of redundant lines of code.

Furthermore, I've adopted a mindset of defending and safeguarding sensitive data, both at an individual and organizational level. Initially, I viewed cybersecurity as solely the domain of the security team, with my role limited to development and testing. However, the Cybersecurity course illuminated the inadequacy of this perspective. Anchored in the CIA Triad of information security, I now understand the importance of individual vigilanceâ€”avoiding exposure of credentials and adhering to security guidelines. Effective communication with teammates and across teams to share incidents, whether failed or successful, is crucial. This collaborative approach ensures the delivery of robust and accountable system applications to our customers.

It's truly inspiring to hear about your experience applying the knowledge gained from the MSBA courses to your industry. Your wrapups serves as a motivational factor for me to invest more energy into understanding course concepts and knowledge points, which could be a better support enhancing our future careers. Personally, I'm particularly intrigued by data processing, and it's fascinating to learn that your daily tasks as a data scientist including SQL tuning, performance monitoring, data aggregation, and reporting. I would love the opportunity to discuss this further with you. Wishing you an enjoyable journey at Trine and a rejuvenating summer break ahead.

I couldn't agree more about the value of the courses, especially the discussion sections, which offer insights beyond the reading materials and contribute significantly to our learning. The mindsets cultivated in various courses prove to be invaluable in refreshing our knowledge base. Additionally, the time management techniques we've learned are practical tools we can apply to our future endeavors. It's great to hear that one of the courses you mentioned is on my schedule for next semester; your endorsement of its informativeness and career benefits is encouraging. I'd love to discuss this further with you if you're available. Wishing you a wonderful time ahead and a well-deserved holiday break.
