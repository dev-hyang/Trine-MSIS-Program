## 19 Question
My internship involves working as a software developer to create new features for a web application. The web application is built on the ASP.NET framework using C#, an object-oriented programming language. I am also responsible for building RESTful APIs using a microservice architecture, enabling the company's platform to integrate with third-party client platforms.

These tasks closely align with the course design of the MSIS program at Trine University. The Java and Object-Oriented Programming courses have given me the strength and confidence to build code blocks effectively. Additionally, the cybersecurity and database courses have paved the way for me to write efficient and secure scripts. I am grateful for this program.


# Final Reflection Dis - by Hang Yang - Sunday, July 14, 2024, 6:26 PM
In the previous semesters, I took a Network Management class instructed by Dwayne Lewis. I want to highlight this because recently we encountered a network issue with our IPsec tunnel built for client integration. The integration pipeline was established almost seven years ago, and unfortunately, there is little documentation on it, with many of the original stakeholders no longer with the company.

On the first day of investigating the production issue, I applied the knowledge I gained from the Network Management course, such as the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and its related commands in both Windows and Linux servers. The course included numerous labs to help us better understand network information exchange. These materials proved to be very practical and helpful in our root cause analysis of the production issue, particularly regarding VPN networks and the specifications for Telnet/Ping, IPv4, and IPv6.

I drafted a basic network diagram based on the course teachings and business specifications. This diagram helped our IT team better understand the network connection failure and ultimately led to the solution. I highly recommend this course to any student working in the IT field.

Thank you for your illustrations and case examples. I am encouraged by your learning goals and case studies at Trine University. At times, I found it challenging to focus on my studies due to the difficulty of maintaining a good GPA while balancing work. Seeing how effectively you've applied knowledge to achieve tangible work outcomes is inspiring and provides a valuable reference for me. Even though I am not in the finance or statistics field, I can see that the course materials are truly beneficial for building a better career in the future. Thank you.
