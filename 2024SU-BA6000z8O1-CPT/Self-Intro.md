## Self intro - 5/15/2024
Hello, everyone,

This is Hang from Chicago, Illinois, which is  a very beautiful city near the Michigan Lake. I'm currently persuing my master of science degree in the Information Studies program at Trine. The motivation for me to consider going back to school is to get a better and deeper understanding in the data and information management, as well as its relationship to IT infrastructure network management. These domains are my weaknesses in my previous works and I really want to be equipped with more knowledge to get to a higher career achievement. 

So far my favorite course is cybersecurity which was led by instructor Jaime, Martinez. His inspiring teaching approaches really impressed me. If you are interested in cyber security domain, I would recommend the course materials from the course which was lectured by IBM cyber experts. Part of the videos are free on Youtube. In this CPT course, I would like to meet new friends and know different domains of career chances. Hope you all have a great time this summer.

Tips: I loves the lakeside landscaping and would spend some time walking along the lake in the summer times.

Hi, Wen Si,

Nice to meet you here at Trine. I had planned to go Boston several years ago but cancelled due to the pandemic. I feel so excited to hear from some stories from Boston. Your domain is quite different from mine as an I.T. support. Usually I would sit behind a monitor and talk with the machine with keyboard. I'm quite interested in what your daily tasks would be. Would there be a lot of meetings with Clients because of the business?

Hope you a great time at Trine.

Hi, Xiaobing,

I'm not in TX, but would say Hello from Chicago, illinois. Both states might have a distinct weather and community culture as far as I know. I'm curious about what details of your regular tasks would be in a fintech domain. There are many business domains would require data and information analytical skills. I've learnt that most people are concerned about the abuse of personal information, some even could be sensitive and confidential. Also, the data breach become a huge risk management in many organizations and I would like to know some from fintech.

Hope you have a good time at Trine and TX.
