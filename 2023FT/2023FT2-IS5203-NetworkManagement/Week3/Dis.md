## Research online to find how much cabling of higher categories would cost. 
1. Choose a higher category that offers better throughput for reasonable costs. 
2. Consider whether you would be able to use existing connectors on devices or if devices would need adapters or replacement.
3. What target cable category did you choose? How much does this cabling cost, on average, per meter?


Among the various Ethernet cables with better throughput, such as CAT-5, CAT-6, CAT-7, and CAT-8, CAT-6 emerges as a standout choice when considering its cost-effectiveness and ability to deliver fast, secure connections compared to other Ethernet cables. While CAT-7 and CAT-8 cables boast faster speeds, the associated installation costs emerge as a critical factor to consider. CAT-6 cables have gained popularity among businesses and homeowners alike, making them my preferred choice due to their widespread usage and proven performance. With a speed potential of up to 250MHz and data transfer rates ranging from 1-10G, CAT-6 surpasses the capabilities of CAT-5, which is limited to speeds of up to 100MHz. 

The average cost of CAT-6 cable per meter (materials-only) falls in the range of $0.5 to $0.8, with variations influenced by factors such as cable quality, brand, and other considerations like labor rates. It's essential to be aware that the average cost per data drop for CAT-6 cabling during installation typically ranges from $120 to $250. A data drop refers to the installation of a connection part or components.

For large, spacious areas, it's advisable to use shielded CAT-6 cables to ensure better signal integrity over a more extensive range. On the other hand, unshielded types are commonly employed by homeowners or in small office LANs with minimal interventions. This knowledge is valuable for making informed decisions before embarking on cable installations.

## How would you explain OFDMA to non-IT executive at your company?
As a connoisseur of delicious food, I'd prefer to use the kitchen as an analogy to explain the term OFDMA:
We can imagine a Wi-Fi network as a shared kitchen with cooking stations. Previously each cooking station could only serve one chef at a time in WiFi 5. With OFDMA in WiFi 6, it's like owning advanced cooking stations that can hold many chefs simultaneously. And each chef would have their own designated space. In this kitchen analogy, OFDMA divides the kitchen into smaller cooking zones, similar to resource units (RUs). The head chef (access point) can efficiently coordinate and support multiple chefs (clients) by assigning them specific cooking zones. 
Even though WiFi 5 had dedicated cooking stations for each chef, Wi-Fi 6 with OFDMA can smartly divide the kitchen into smaller, specicial featured cooking zones for simultaneous use. How to assign the zones to each chef is up to many factors like the importance of their dishes (quality-of-service requirements),  the size of their recipes (packet size), and the kitchen's overall goal of ensuring a smooth cooking process. This flexible scheduling, combined with the parallel processing nature of OFDMA, greatly enhances the overall efficiency of the Wi-Fi network.

I appreciate the thorough explanation and research on the cabling category choice. I wholeheartedly agree that the CAT-6 series stands out as a superior option compared to series like 5 or 7. Given the limitations of CAT-5 in terms of maximum speed and data transfer rate, and the cost-prohibitive nature of CAT-7/8, it's reasonable to expect CAT-6 to remain a top choice for the foreseeable future. However, we should also acknowledge that future innovations, especially with the integration of AI and machine learning technologies, may lead to more frequent and rapid advancements in this field.

Thank you for introducing the upcoming cabling category of 8 as the successor to CAT 6a. I am optimistic that as the technology continues to mature, the initial high cost of Category 8 will likely decrease, making it accessible to every household and a valuable investment. This advancement is poised to significantly enhance people's network experience, boosting both working efficiency and communication experiences. Such improvements could, in turn, attract additional investment and foster business growth in this field. Additionally, understanding the detailed speed comparison between WiFi 5 and WiFi 6 provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of wireless connectivity.
