This is an assignment activity to ensure you are aware of your CPT authorization dates. As a reminder, you are only authorized for a maximum of 1 year CPT at a time. If you are planning to request and extension on your CPT authorization, you need to plan ahead for CPT renewal. Please note that the CPT authorization dates on your I20 are not the same as the CPT course end date. For the entire time of CPT authorization, you are required to be enrolled in a CPT course each semester. In most cases, your CPT authorization end date will expire before the end of the CPT course end date, which means even if you are still enrolled in the CPT course, your authorization has ended, and you are not allowed to work. To avoid this, it is your responsibility to actively monitor the CPT authorization end date on the back of your I20 and submit a new CPT authorization request form when needed.
This assignment is due 12/10. No credit is awarded for late assignments.

Reflection is an opportunity for you as the learner and the employee to take a moment to analyze your progress as a professional.  There are a few terms to consider when reflecting, that may guide you as you engage in this process.

* Recalling: Recall specific episodes or events that provide evidence that you have grown as a learner and employee. Also recall, though it may be difficult, those instances where you could improve your behavior.
* Recapturing: Capture the emotions, accomplishments, and challenges that you’ve experienced during the span of this course.
* Relating: Connect those recollections with other experiences that you’ve had in the past. Have you progressed? And you regressed? What steps can you take to future improve.
* Rationalizing: Evaluate the patterns or learning experiences to create meaning from the past events.
* Redirecting: Engage in purposeful thinking directed toward future actions and goals.

During the past weeks of juggling study and work in a hybrid mode, I had the opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired from the Advanced Database course to my professional endeavors. These applications have significantly enhanced the robustness and efficiency of the software I build for my employer, and they have garnered high praise. Among the various insights gained, I would like to highlight the following key points:

* **Database Design and Selection**: The choice of a database depends on the size and purpose of your application, as well as the associated Database Management System (DBMS). For personal or small projects, open-source databases are often readily available and cost-effective. However, in commercial contexts, it is typically advisable to invest in the commercial version for better support and security features, especially for applications involving government or military use.
* **Database Performance Optimization**: Prior to my coursework, I primarily focused on optimizing SQL statements to enhance database performance. However, the course illuminated a more holistic approach. I learned to consider higher-level architectural choices, such as determining whether the application is suitable for NoSQL databases, in-memory solutions like Redis or Memcached, or real-time log analysis using Elasticsearch. Furthermore, optimizing the database starts at the schema design phase, encompassing considerations like field types, relationships, foreign keys, indexes, and alternative indexes. Once this infrastructure is in place, one can delve into fine-tuning SQL execution, which involves optimizing cardinality in joins, data aggregation, and query selection.
* **Database Security**: Considering the ongoing threat of cyberattacks, the protection of sensitive and confidential data is of utmost importance. I have gained proficiency in employing diverse strategies to address database security issues, which encompass preventing data leaks, fortifying defenses against SQL injection, eliminating potential vulnerabilities, and restricting unauthorized access.(Yong et al., 2021) By implementing this knowledge in my work, we were able to identify and promptly rectify several vulnerabilities, enhancing our overall security posture.
Incorporating these lessons from my Advanced Database course has proven to be immensely beneficial in ensuring the efficiency, security, and reliability of our database systems.

Hi, Yucao,
It's truly inspiring to witness your significant accomplishments in your past finance and engineering courses. Sometimes, software developers tend to concentrate solely on honing their programming skills without fully exploring the domain-specific business concepts. I believe these insights are incredibly valuable, especially for software developers working in the financial sector. Although my current industry is not finance-related, I am convinced that this knowledge will expand my horizons and open up opportunities to navigate across various industries. Listening to your experience sharing has provided me with a valuable framework to structure my own SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals when I embark on this course in the future. 
Thanks

Hi, Tong,
I greatly appreciate your well-structured insights into your past course experiences and professional journey. Your revelations about the significance of project management in daily task organization and career advancement were truly unexpected and eye-opening. Previously, I held the misconception that project management was primarily a tedious and detail-oriented role suited for individuals in dedicated PM positions. However, your sharing has enlightened me to my previous misperceptions and errors.
Moving forward, I intend to be more attentive in my work, seeking opportunities to effectively integrate project management concepts such as innovation strategy and engineering economics into my daily tasks. Your experiences have motivated me to embrace these principles and harness their potential for personal and professional growth.
Thanks
