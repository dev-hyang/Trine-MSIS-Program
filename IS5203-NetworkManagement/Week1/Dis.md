# What is a real-life example of how layers in a system indirectly connect two entities (such as a person or company) in communication?
In the earlier days, the process of placing food orders at restaurants was a manual affair. To illustrate this, we can draw the following analogies:
* **Browsers**: These are akin to the customers visiting the restaurant.
* **Messages**: Represent the orders placed by the customers.
* **Operating System**: Can be compared to the role of the waiters at the restaurant.
* **Hardware**: Refers to the physical restaurant facilities, including items like order notes.
* **Server**: Corresponds to the cook responsible for preparing the dishes.

When customers arrived at the restaurant, they would be seated and patiently wait for a waiter to attend to them. Once seated, the waiters would present the customers with a menu of recipes. When ready to order, the customers would signal the waiters, often by waving, indicating their desire to place an order. The waiters would then jot down these orders on paper notes. Subsequently, they would convey these order notes to the kitchen and inform the cook of the dishes to be prepared. Throughout this process, all parties involved adhered to specific rules. For instance, both the customers and the waiters had to use the same recipe menu and dish names to ensure that the cook understood how to prepare the ingredients and cook the dishes accurately.

# What did you learn about your chosen career path that you did not already know?
There are three main aspects in the industry that I find particularly interesting:
1. The first aspect is mastering the fundamental skills that software developers should possess. This includes a mix of technical skills and soft skills. These skills have proven to be highly beneficial in my prior work experiences. It's essential to avoid bias, as different positions may prioritize certain skills over others.
2. While salary is a consideration, it's not the most important factor. The salaries of software developers vary a lot depending on market demand and the supply of specific roles. Patience and continuous skill improvement are key for long-term success.
3. The third aspect involves acquiring specialized skills when possible. With a growing number of entry-level and junior software developers entering the market through two or four-year programs or short-term bootcamps, there is a shared foundational understanding of IT knowledge. To excel among the abundance of talent, it's advantageous to learn and master specialized skills such as cloud computing, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and more.
