# Init Discussion

My name is Hang Yang, and I’m based in Chicago. Before pursuing my master’s degree at Trine University, I spent several years working in software development. In my previous projects, I worked with various data storage and analytics tools, including MySQL/NoSQL, Snowflake, Redshift, and Python. I also built several ETL data pipelines to prepare filtered and clean data for downstream teams.

Although R is new to me, I understand it’s a powerful programming language comparable to Python, particularly for data analysis and processing. I’m excited about the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in using R to create data analytics projects and to learn together as a team.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and reading.
