In my canva infographic, it's a diagram of discrete probability and continuous probability comparison. Those two concepts are to describe the probability distributions of the population. Discrete probability distribution focus on the discrete random variables where a probability function is provided for each random variable. We could use any of the three assigning probability methods: classical, relative frequency, or subjective to build the discrete probability distribution presented in tabular format. In contrast, continuous probability distribution focus on continuous random variables. Because the probability of an interval is the area of the interval under the probability density function, the probability of an exact value on x-axis does not make sense. Binomial distribution is a very common discrete probability distribution that's widely applied in finance and biology areas. Normal distribution is another common continuous probability distribution that plays an important role in analyzing the natural phenomena such as time, size and weight.

Hi, Moinuddin Syed Khwaja

I belived this is a good explanation of the definition of the discrete and continous probabilities. Discrete probability is to measure the likelihood of a certain outcome occurrence of all potential event outcomes. The common discrete probability distributions are nomial and poisson distribution which are widely used in the finance and medicine fields. In the contrast, thanks for pointing out the uncountability character for the potential outcomes space within the continuous probability. So it make no sense for a specific value's probability comparing to the infinite outcomes.

Hi, Jingyu Shang,

Thanks for the organized and specific introduction of the differences between discrete and continous probabilities. From the definition of each distribution we could know that the key difference between discrete and continous probability is the object they are measuring. "Discrete" means that the event outcomes are individually separated and can be counted. Continuous means that the event outcomes are an unbroken whole without interruption which could inspires us of most of natural characters like size, time and weight etc. It's also worth pointing out the similarities in probability rules and goals, but the extra differences in probability computation and outcome range.
