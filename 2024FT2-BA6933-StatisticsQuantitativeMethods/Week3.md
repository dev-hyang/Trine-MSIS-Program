In my canva infographic, it's a contrast diagram of definition and highlights of sampling distribution, interval estimates and hypothesis testing. Sampling distribution stands for the distribution of a sample statistics (such as a sample mean) drawn from a set of samples of the same size. It is the key to learn and master the knowledge of statistics inference foundation. Interval estimate applies the concept of point estimate to range estimate by providing a range of confidence level where the population parameter is highly possible within. Hypothesis testing uses the sampling distribution concepts to develop claims over the population, as well as judging either the claim should or should not be accepted based on the comparison of p-value, or critical values with the level of significance. These there concepts together provide us inference approach on the population, as well as widely used in the data-driven decision making fields like social sciences, lab studies and business investment.

Hi, Gyana,

This is a really intuitive diagram to show the definitions and relationships between the three core concepts in the statistics inference. Among all of them, the sampling distribution measures the probability of sampling parameters, like sample mean, sample proportion, which spread over the samples selected from the population. It is also the foundation module for both the interval estimate and hypothesis testing. It's really a great illustration for this topic. Thanks.

Hi, Yunxin,

It is really a great succint diagram of comparison on the sampling distrubtion, confidence interval and hypothesis testing from your assignment. The only improvement I could find in the diagram might locate in the hypothesis testing. The picture might differ a little bit with test statistics and p-value on the test statistics. Or the one-tailed test, two-tailed test would also play a key role in either rejecting or not rejecting a null hypothesis.
