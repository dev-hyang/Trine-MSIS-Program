## Podcast viewpoints

1. Operational Cyber - 
* is mainly focusing on contest in tography within three areas: Blue space, red space and gray space 
* diff from normal IT: is operation, maintenance and function
	* maintain/build/admin applications in a network
	* permission/role-based access 
	* monitoring CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
	* 
* blue space: also called friendly/ally space, what you are trying to get done right, ensure whole organization to have free access/operation to complete daily tasks. Traditinoal IT falls into this category
	* blue team: which defend the blue space
* red space: also called enemy space, deny free operation/access within your network, take away the CIA, block info stream and break the network.
	* 4d's: disruption, degradation, denial, destruction
	* sometimes it's just enemy emunation so that we could test the strength of Blue team/space
* purple team: also called friendly red team. If you can't afford blue/red team separately, then the Purple team could work for you. It's a combination of blue and red team with essential skills/tools to do both team's work.
* gray space: intelligence space/information space, 

The big curse of a blue team is normal everyday users; the big curse to a red team is excellent awareness in the cyber domain by normal people.

## My Viewpoint
I align closely with Dr. McIver's perspective on the definition of Operational Cyber, especially when contrasted with conventional IT services and activities.
