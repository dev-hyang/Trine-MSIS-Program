Hello, everyone! I'm Hang Yang, a nature explorer with a master's degree in Computer Science. My journey began as a full-stack web application developer in the vibrant city of Chicago. Witnessing the profound impact of the internet on our lives, I can't help but marvel at the transformative power it holds. The ubiquity of the network has become integral to our daily existence.

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I've come to recognize the critical importance of cybersecurity. The escalating issues of data leaks and privacy concerns have captured my attention. I firmly believe that acquiring cybersecurity skills is not only essential for understanding the industry but also for fostering a heightened awareness as we navigate the digital realm.

As I embark on this course, my expectations are centered around enhancing my proficiency in designing robust security systems. I aim to delve into the intricacies of risk management, threat management, and intrusion detection. This knowledge will not only fortify my skill set but also contribute to creating a safer and more secure digital environment. I'm excited about the learning journey ahead and the valuable insights this class will undoubtedly provide.

Nice to meet you in the Cybersecurity course. As an backend SDE, I'm curious about the Clound Engineering and how the cloud developers are going to handle the security issues. It's said there are some gaps between cloud and on-premise severs. Looking forward to your sharing on these parts if possible.
