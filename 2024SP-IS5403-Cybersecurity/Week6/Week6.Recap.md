# Prof Samuel Nop "Cyber Threat Intelligence" - Week 6

My biggest gaining on this podcast is that the key of cyber threat intelligence remains the same like what Prof. Samuel has done in the previous government related work. Cyber intelligence excels at analyzing information, which could provide advantage over decision making and operational lubricant. It is a proactive strategy aimed at analyzing and delivering crucial information to company boards. It forewarns about potential threats such as ransomware attacks, vulnerabilities in the network, or potential data breaches that could affect your business. By gathering, aggregating, and analyzing cyber threat data relevant to your system, threat intelligence offers insights to help you allocate your financial and non-financial resources effectively. Ultimately, it empowers you to prioritize and address specific potential threats before they escalate into major security incidents. 

With regard to open source intelligence, it's mixture of both free and fee-charged intelligence tool to prevent or limit cyber threats to the organization.
When mentioning about different roles on the cyber security, Prof. Samuel thought the cyber analyst could rely more on the threat intelligence as their job could be substituted or delegated to the intelligence tool. The cyber operator is the cyber defender. A good cyber analyst is going to build up really good analytical skills to make them fully qualified for the complicated network. They maybe able to aggregate different data points from different domain within different network, but draw a picture that something is going to happen to harm the system. The capability helps those analyst stands out among others.

How to view 3rd party security intelligence blogs, is it reputable or not? Trust but verify. You could collect these data as a source as it's available in the internet for everyone. However, it could be reputable or not reputable. From time to time, after verification, you could build up a open list of these reputable sites. This could be a good reference in future. To verify it, you could check its updating timeline and contributors if they are black hat, gray hat or white hat hackers.

Talking about sharing of the intelligence, always keep your legal team involved to ensure that you are doing the right things and doing them right.

What was your biggest takeaway from podcast? 
What is open-source intelligence? Is open-source intelligence enough to keep a network secure?  
Give 3 example of Cyber Intelligence sites

===> Solution

My biggest gain on this podcast is that cyber intelligence excels at analyzing information, which could provide advantage over decision making and operational lubricant. It's noteworthy that the significance of cyber threat intelligence is gaining traction beyond just military or government sectors, as emphasized by Prof. Samuel's experience. Its relevance is expanding to encompass various industries and organizations, reflecting a growing recognition of its importance in safeguarding against cyber threats. Cyber intelligence is a proactive strategy aimed at analyzing and delivering crucial information to company boards. It forewarns about potential threats such as ransomware attacks, vulnerabilities in the network, or potential data breaches that could affect your business. By gathering, aggregating, and analyzing cyber threat data relevant to your system, threat intelligence offers insights to help you allocate your financial and non-financial resources effectively. Ultimately, it empowers you to prioritize and address specific potential threats before they escalate into major security incidents. 

With regard to open source intelligence, it means public websites, articles or blogs where you could freely retrieve cyber threat related information. Based on my understanding on the dicussion, Prof. Samuel did highlight the use of open source threat intelligence highly rely on the size of your project or organization. For financial resource limited project, you probably would take open source tools. However, if budget allows, it's recommended to use mixture of both free and fee-charged intelligence tool to prevent or limit cyber threats to the organization. Also, it's always a good idea to involve your legal team when talking about usage and sharing of the intelligence. We would want to ensure that we are doing the right things and doing them right.

3 popular cyber intelligence websites:
* https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories?page=0 is a cyber intelligence website maintained by US government
* https://redcanary.com/topic/threat-intelligence/ offers information on malwares, threat compaigns, new activity clusters, etc
* https://isc.sans.edu/ is a voluntary website for security experts
* https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/topic/threat-intelligence/ is well-known because of seas of threats to its world-wide popular operating system

I would agree on taking advantage of machine learning models to recognize and filter out cyber threats. In fact, most of the popular intelligence tools are built on advanced ML/AI information algorithms, such as data mining, text mining, pattern mining, CNNs and GNNS. It would be interesting to consider the latest LLMs into this area. Another concern on these open source cyber intelligence information is their accountability. This has been discussed in the podcast, whether it's reputable or not does not really matter. It's a data feeding and data source should be able to handle the bias or anomalies. However, if you want to find something trustable, it's highly recommended to check their contributor, update frequence of these open source intelligence.

It's noteworthy that the open source intelligence is really wonderful data store for cybersecurity professionals. We are all aware that decision making highly relies on information. The open source works as publicly available free information pool. And good quality trusted intelligence sites could provide information more than you could imagine. These data feedings could help training your threat intelligence if it run on some machine learning algorithms. To be added, if your organization's financial resource allows, it's always recommended to use the mixture of open source and fee-charged intelligence. Because they could mutually benefit each other, just like the complete set of two union sets could complement each other and strengthen your organization's security defense.


# Storytime with DocMcIver "Contested Environment" Week 7 IS5403

Contested environment defines a scenario that you are competing with someone or yourself. Especially in the cyber security area, you would take every defensive actions to protect yourself or your organization from attacking by malicious attacks time to time. You should be aware that the offsensive attackers are always trying to break your system either for money, political or other reasons. If you defensive tricks do not play well, the attackers would know how to sneak in. Sometimes the contest could be very complicated due to the challenges: like hybrid architecture, short of defense skillsets or tools, unknown variants and even more. Here are some recommended steps for you to consider when building your defensive strategies. First of all, you could build your foundations of secure infrastructure from collecting all the needs from your business, your partners, your employees and your customers. Secondly, you need to priority these requirements and put most of your efforts into the highest priority needs. Based on different needs, the highest need could be the customer-first for customer-facing service companies, partner-first for vendor-facing service companies, or employee-first for talent companies. 

Like Dr. Maclver introduced, you should also be aware of the difference between stakeholders and customers. Stakerholders, sometimes also called partners, are part of the business that share the common benefits with you. They could be your vendors, funders, or even your competetors. A good example is the relationship between commercial/retail banks, sometimes they would compete with each other to attract deposits, but each of them could also be partners to defend bank domain security attacks or even in business part, to transfer money from one bank to another bank, or borrow money. etc.
Thirdly, you could drafted your playbook picture to make appropriate defensive steps, like firewall, anti-malware tool, SIEM tool, monitoring, recovery and report.

There are lots of things that cyber security professionals could do to strenthen and defend their system. These suggesions are free from Dr. Maclver for cyber security professionals, identifying the assets you want to secure, priority the assets, design defensive strategy on these assets with good understanding of risk management, patching program, user training. PACE plan is short of primary alternate contingency emergency.
