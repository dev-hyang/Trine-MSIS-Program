This is an assignment activity to ensure you are aware of your CPT authorization dates. As a reminder, you are only authorized for a maximum of 1 year CPT at a time. If you are planning to request and extension on your CPT authorization, you need to plan ahead for CPT renewal. Please note that the CPT authorization dates on your I20 are not the same as the CPT course end date. For the entire time of CPT authorization, you are required to be enrolled in a CPT course each semester. In most cases, your CPT authorization end date will expire before the end of the CPT course end date, which means even if you are still enrolled in the CPT course, your authorization has ended, and you are not allowed to work. To avoid this, it is your responsibility to actively monitor the CPT authorization end date on the back of your I20 and submit a new CPT authorization request form when needed.
This assignment is due 12/10. No credit is awarded for late assignments.
