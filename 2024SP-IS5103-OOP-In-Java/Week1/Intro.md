Hi, everyone! I'm Hang Yang, a deep-dish crust enthusiast based in Chicago. Holding a master's degree in Computer Science, I embarked on my career as a full-stack web application developer after graduating in Chicago. This vibrant city provided an ideal environment for connecting with real-world requirements from both internal operations teams and external clients. Collaborating with talented team members, our shared motivation was delivering high-reliability, availability, and durable products to our end-users. In my daily work, I consider Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) a crucial tech tool in my future career to become a staff developer. Mastering OOP concepts is essential for building elegant code blocks and a robust platform. Currently, I'm eager to delve deeper into OOP's concepts and practices, particularly in Java programming within this course.

Nice to meet you! Your extensive industry experience is quite impressive. I'm curious about the daily tasks of a Microsoft SDE. Could you provide insights into whether Microsoft SDEs predominantly use Java or C# (.NET) in their projects? I'm eagerly anticipating taking the course with you.
