# Comments are a part of a program.  Discuss what are program comments.  In your discussion explain why comments are used as well as the different types of comments.  In addition to including a comment example.

Program comments are to annotate or to explain the meaning or purpose the code block logic. Most of the times, the comments are embedded within the source codebase. Their primary purpose is to provide additional information, explanations, or documentation about the code, making it easier for developers to understand the logic and for readers to comprehend the program or application.

Key points about program comments:
## Explanation and Documentation:
Comments serve as a form of documentation, providing insights into the design, functionality, or reasoning behind specific sections of code. This can be especially helpful for developers who work on the codebase later or for collaborators who may need to understand the code

## Quality vs. Quantity
The quality of comments is more important than their quantity. It's not about adding as many comments as possible, but about providing meaningful and relevant information where it is most needed. Clear, concise, and informative comments contribute to the readability and maintainability of the code

## Best Practices and Standards
Following best practices and adhering to coding standards is crucial for consistent and maintainable code. Many organizations define coding standards or conventions that include guidelines for commenting. Adhering to these standards ensures a uniform and easily understandable codebase across the team or organization

```
/**
 * This is a sample of Javadoc comment.
 *
 * @param statement The String parameter.
 * @param num The numeric parameter.
 * @return The result of some integer return type.
 */
public int demoMethod(String statement, int num) {
    // take some operation
    // System.out.print("print something");
    // for-loop 
    // calculation
    return 0;
}
```

Thank you for the concise overview of program comments. It's crucial to emphasize the non-executable nature of program comments, which significantly contributes to their importance. Since comments do not incur compile-time costs, developers can freely integrate them into the codebase without impacting the efficiency of the compilation process. The storage cost of comments is relatively inexpensive compared to the runtime of the program, making them a valuable tool for enhancing code readability and maintainability.

This illustration wonderfully captures the essential roles that program comments play. In essence, they contribute to improved code organization, fostering seamless collaboration among developers and ultimately enhancing maintenance efficiency. The utilization of two common types of comments—block comments and inline comments—is a classic and globally recognized pattern across various programming languages, thanks to industry standards. It prompts thoughtful consideration about whether it's worthwhile to create distinct comment patterns for different programming languages. This highlights the universality and importance of adopting established conventions to facilitate clear communication and collaboration within the software development community.
